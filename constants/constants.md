# Constants

A const statement can appear anywhere a var statement can.


Constant expressions perform arithmetic with arbitrary precision.


A numeric constant has no type until it’s given one, such as by an explicit cast.


A number can be given a type by using it in a context that requires one, such as a variable assignment or function call. For example, here math.Sin expects a float64.
